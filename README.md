### Submission Guidelines for Assignments
First, fork the repository and clone it in your local machine. Create a folder of the format rollno_name with your roll no and name (for eg, 210944_SaumyaGupta in my case). Create folder Assignment1 inside the previous folder and upload your solution files there. Also, make sure that no other file is changed. Commit your changes and generate a pull request.

Note: Follow the submission guidelines strictly.
